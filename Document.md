Here is a **world-class benchmark study** you can use to design the **Wekeza CRM** (Bank-grade, multi-channel: Mobile + Web + Desktop).
I’ll structure this like a **product strategy document**, not just a list.

# Part 1 — What “World-Class CRM” Means in 2025–2026

Across Gartner/Forrester/G2 leaders, the top systems share four core success factors:

**1) AI-first architecture**

* Predictive next-best action
* Generative summaries & recommendations
* Conversational CRM assistants

**2) Unified customer view (360°)**

* All interactions: branch, mobile app, call center, WhatsApp, ATM

**3) Deep integration**

* Core banking, payments, ERP, marketing, analytics

**4) Security & compliance**

* Role-based access, audit trails, regulatory controls

These factors define modern CRM leadership. ([ARP Ideas][1])

For a **bank**, this becomes:

> Customer Intelligence Platform + Engagement Engine + Service Platform.
