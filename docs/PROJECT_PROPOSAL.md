## 1. Project Background

### 1.1 Organizational Context
Wekeza Bank is a leading financial institution serving 50,000+ customers across retail, SME, and corporate segments. As part of our 2025-2027 digital transformation strategy, we recognize the critical need to modernize customer relationship management.

### 1.2 Current Situation
Our current customer management approach faces significant limitations:
- Customer data scattered across 5+ disconnected systems
- Average case resolution time of 72 hours (vs. 24-hour industry standard)
- Manual, paper-based processes account for 60% of operations
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT) at 65% (below 80% industry average)
- Annual customer churn at 15% (vs. 10% industry benchmark)
- Limited ability to personalize service or identify opportunities

### 1.3 Need for Change
The competitive landscape demands digital excellence. Modern customers expect:
- Fast, personalized service across all channels
- Self-service capabilities
- Proactive engagement
- Consistent experience
- Transparent communication

Without modernization, we risk losing market share to digitally-advanced competitors and failing to meet customer expectations.
